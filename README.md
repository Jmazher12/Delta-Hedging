# Delta-Hedging
This MATLAB project simulates and analyzes a dynamic delta-hedged portfolio with stock, put, and call options. It uses Monte Carlo methods and Black-Scholes pricing to evaluate hedging performance, visualize results, and provide statistical insights for quantitative finance research.

## Features
Simulates 1,000 price paths for stock and index using geometric Brownian motion

Implements Black-Scholes option pricing and delta calculation

Models weekly delta hedging and tracks associated costs

Calculates profit & loss for hedged, unhedged, and buy-and-hold strategies

Outputs summary tables, percentiles, and statistical metrics

Generates histograms to visualize P&L and option value distributions

Fully commented code for clarity and learning

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
MATLAB R2018b or later

## Usage
Copy and paste the delta_hedge_simulation.m code in MATLAB.

Run the script to generate results and figures.

## Customization
Change strike prices, volatilities, or other parameters at the top of the script to explore different scenarios.

Adjust the number of Monte Carlo simulations by modifying the N parameter.

Extend the analysis or visualizations as needed for your research
